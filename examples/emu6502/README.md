### EhBASIC Example
Letâ€™s try a few things again:

PRINT 1+2, 1/3, SIN(PI/4)
 3             .333333       .707107

## EhBASIC

Enhanced BASIC is a BASIC interpreter for the 6502 family microprocessors.
It is constructed to be quick and powerful and easily ported between 6502 systems.
It requires few resources to run and includes instructions to facilitate easy
low level handling of hardware devices. It also retains most of the powerful
high level instructions from similar BASICs.

EhBASIC is free but not copyright free. For non commercial use there is only one
restriction, any derivative work should include, in any binary image distributed,
the string "Derived from EhBASIC" and in any distribution that includes human
readable files a file that includes the above string in a human readable form
e.g. not as a comment in an HTML file.

For commercial use please contact Lee Davison at leeedavison@googlemail.com
for conditions.
